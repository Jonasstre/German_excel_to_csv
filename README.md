# German_excel_to_csv
 Script for converting german excel files to csv format.
 The script uses Pandas. The "dist" folder contains an executable that can be dropped anywhere. It will convert all .xlsx files in the Subfolder "Files". The   generated .csv files are comma seperated and use the decimal dot.
 Your folder Structure should thus be:
 <pre>
 -ANYFOLDER-
     Ger_ExcelToCSV.exe
     -Files-
         YourExcelFile.xlsx
 <\pre>
